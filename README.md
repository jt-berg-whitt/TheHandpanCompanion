# The Handpan Companion — React (Vite) scaffold

This is a small React app managed with Vite for my book, The Handpan Companion, with four pages: Home, About, Book and Interviews.

The site hosts the entire contents of the book itself, all 70+ interviews I performed with handpanists around the world from over 12 different native languages, as well as links to the artists' social media, external historical information links, studies and published works, and embedded music for each artist in the interviews.

I will update this README more later.
