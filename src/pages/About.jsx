      <p>This project began when I realized the community lacked a single source of truth about the handpan and its intricacies. Handpan.org was long-since defunct and there wasn't already a comprehensive "one-stop-shop" resource. Sure, many makers offer some historical information on their websites and Master the Handpan offers lists of all the makers they're aware of, educational blog posts and other information, and Saraz and Hagane both have many scale explanations and audio samples.</p> 
      
      <p>These, however, were strewn across many websites and even within those sites, many separate pages. I figured that a book where everything was in <i>one place</i> was a much better solution. I aim to continually gather current information on historical milestones, instrument care, and playing techniques.</p>

      <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
      <p>Beginner and intermediate players, instrument makers, and anyone curious about the instrument's community and practice.</p>

      <h3>How to contribute</h3>
      <p>Send contributions as markdown or suggested edits; you can add audio clips, interview transcripts, or articles about technique.</p>
